				How might we help students work productively in 
				non-traditional desk settings? <br>
				<br>
				Our team noticed that students across campus were doing 
				their work in uncomfortable positions when traditional 
				desks were not available. Slick, a portable lap desk that 
				fits easily into any backpack, is our solution to this 
				problem space. </div>

				In order to do our user observation and confirm our initial thoughts, our team headed out to the lake. 
                We made sure to choose a day where the weather was nice, because this is when students are most inclined 
                to work outside. We were not disappointed to find that most students were indeed doing their work hunched 
                over in uncomfortable positions. In addition to visually observing the working students, we also asked 
                several questions about working in a non-traditional desk setting. Mainly the questions centered around what 
                material or aspect of a lap desk would be most convenient for a student. We then took these answers into 
				consideration when creating our prototypes and subsequent iterations.

				After our first observation, we noticed a few key points that influenced our design decisions. Something that we did 
                not account for was the role of height of each individual person when they hunch down. We realized that we couldn’t 
                create a one size lap desk if our goal was for students to be more comfortable and not have to hunch down. This 
                consideration allowed us to create a design that deviated away from the traditional lap desks. We created a two piece 
                desk with a sliding mechanism. This allows the user to adjust the height of the desk to meet his or her needs. The two 
                pieces of the desk relies on a strong magnetic strip to slide up and down.
